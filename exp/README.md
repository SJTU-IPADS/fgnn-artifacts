# Experiments

## Default Hardware Configurations
- 2 * 24 cores Intel Xeon Platinum 8163 CPUs
- 512GB RAM
- 8 * 16GB NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs

**Note: If you don't have the same hardware environments, you should go into subdirectories(i.e. figXX or tableXX), follow the instructions to modify some script configurations, and then run the experiment**

## Run All Experiments

Running all the experiments will take hours. 
We don't recommend running  all the experiments at one time.


```sh
make all
```

## Run One Experiment

`make figXX.run`(e.g. `make fig4a.run`) or `make  tableXX.run` (e.g. `make table1.run`)

or `cd figXX/tableXX` and follow the instruction to run the experiment.

## Clean The Run Logs

```sh
make clean
```

### Experiment Output

The experiment output files are in the subdirectories(`figXX/run-logs` or `figXX/output_XXXXXXX`).
